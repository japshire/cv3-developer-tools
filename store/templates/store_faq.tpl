            <div class="ans">
		We encourage you to discover new teas and join our botanical journey to leave No Leaf Unturned.  We developed the “Teaser” sample size to make it easier to try out new teas before you commit to a larger pack size.  Our sourcing team travels the world, visiting the origins of our teas and botanicals to work side-by-side with farmers to verify the crop quality, season after season.  In this direct trade spirit, we are confident you will enjoy the aroma and flavor of your Rishi tea.  Your tasting notes are most appreciated in our sourcing journey.  Please reach out to our <a href="mailto:customerservice@rishi-tea.com">Customer Service</a> team if you feel the quality of your purchase did not satisfy your expectation.  For more information about Exchanges & Returns, see the FAQ’s below.<br>

		To exchange or return unopened and undamaged tea and teaware purchased from our website or customer service representative, please send to the address listed below within <strong>30 days of delivery date</strong>.  While we are happy to refund the cost of the unopened or undamaged tea or wares, the return shipment costs are at your expense.  If you’d like to exchange for a different offering, Rishi will assume the cost of shipping you the replacement product.  Please note that if asking for a refund, the final amount is reflected net of any discount or promotional pricing.<br><br>Rishi Tea<br>ATTN: Receiving Department<br>185 S. 33rd Court<br>Milwaukee, WI 53208<br>

            <p class="ques"><strong>What if I have opened my tea or used my teaware?</strong></p>
            <div class="ans">
		We’re thrilled you have tried something new.  If you feel the quality of any of our offerings is anything less than you expected, please reach out to us within <strong>30 days of package delivery date</strong> at <a href="mailto:customerservice@rishi-tea.com">Customer Service</a> or 877.552.7977.  We do not honor exchanges or refunds if the issue is not quality-driven, but is rather a matter of personal taste.  Please note that as an agricultural product, some seasonal variance is to be expected in the flavor profiles of tea.  For this reason we recommend first purchasing smaller quantities such as our "Teaser" sample size, ensuring the tea is to your liking before committing to larger bags.  For insight into the most recent crop tasting notes, reach out to our  <a href="mailto:customerservice@rishi-tea.com">Customer Service</a> team and we'll help you decide the right teas for you.

            <p class="ques"><strong>How can I return tea and teaware purchased from an outside retailer?</strong></p>
            <div class="ans">
		Rishi gladly partners with outside retailers to bring our teas to you. We ask you first seek a return through that original partner, but we are happy to help when possible.  Remaining consistent with our own web store policy, returns or refunds are only honored for issues that are based on quality concern, not those that are tied to personal taste preferences.  In cases where there is a quality concern, we are happy to offer an exchange, with the submittal of proof of purchase within the past 30 days.
