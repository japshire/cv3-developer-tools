<h4 align="center"><a href="http://www.google.com/maps/place/S+33rd+Ct,+Milwaukee,+WI+53208" target=_blank" style="text-decoration:none">185 S. 33rd Court<br>
Milwaukee, WI 53208</a></h4>

 
Our new location in the Menomonee Valley puts us in the heart of downtown Milwaukee. It’s a tea facility never before seen in the United States, complete with aroma segregation, temperature and humidity control, and a state-of-the-art tea training lab – all putting Rishi Tea at the forefront of our industry.
