Rishi Tea is committed to supporting the many tea growing communities we work at origin, as well as the community we are a part of both locally and nationally. As a direct-importer of organic and fair trade loose leaf teas, issues like health, the environment and education are near and dear to us; we are happy to help support a great mission with great tea!
