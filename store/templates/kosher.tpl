<strong>What is Kosher?</strong><br>
The term Kosher refers to food that conforms to Jewish dietary laws. According to Wisconsin-K, there are three main elements to kosher food: the animal or plant from which the food derives, the method in which the animal is killed or the way in which the plant is harvested, and finally, the manner of food preparation.<br><br>

Each of these elements requires knowledge and experience which Wisconsin-K offers. The hechsher, or kosher certification on our product labels signify that all the kosher conditions have been established and met.</p></div>
