<h2 class="checkout_title">Returns Policy FAQ's</h2>
<strong>How do refund requests work?</strong><br />
We're very sorry if you are unsatisfied with your purchase. As a company founded on setting new standards for premium caliber, sustainably sourced teas, we take tremendous pride in the quality of our products. If you are unsatisfied with any purchase, you may submit a refund request within 30 days of delivery. <br />
<br />
In most cases, we will ask you to return the defective product to us. When returning an item, please attach the address label found on your order invoice onto the package you’d like to return to Rishi Tea. If you no longer have your invoice, you may also print the address label below, fill it in, and send it to us with your return. If your return involves goods that arrived damaged or were an incorrect shipment by Rishi Tea, you will be fully refunded for the merchandise and return shipping charges. You are responsible for the shipping costs associated with all other product returns. Credits will be applied to your original method of payment within 2-4 weeks following the approval of the return request. <br /><br />

<strong>Can I return items purchased at a store to www.rishi-tea.com? </strong><br />
Unfortunately, this is not possible. The items you purchase at a store have been purchased from Rishi Tea by that store. Returns of this nature must be settled at the site of purchase.<br /><br />

For your protection, please send your return via carriers who offer package tracking such as UPS (be sure to retain your tracking receipt for future reference). Rishi Tea is not responsible for lost shipments and shipping charges are non-refundable. In some areas, you may choose to receive your order as an unattended delivery. Rishi Tea is not responsible, and you agree not to hold Rishi Tea or its employees responsible for any damage or theft that occurs to an unattended delivery.<br />
<br />

<strong>What if I made a purchase through PayPal?</strong><br />
Purchases made through PayPal may be returned to Rishi Tea for credit. When returning an order purchased through PayPal to Rishi Tea, the applicable credit will be applied to your PayPal account.<br />
