 We drink a lot of tea here at the Rishi offices.  If you think about it, that’s a lot of tealeaves that could be put to good use! That’s why we’ve partnered with Growing Power, to put the tealeaves to use in their composts.  Growing Power, a self-sustaining urban farm from our hometown of Milwaukee, educates teens, farmers and communities on sustainable farming practices in the U.S. through workshops, training, outreach and technical assistance.<br><br>
